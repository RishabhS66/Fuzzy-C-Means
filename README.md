# Fuzzy-C-Means
Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is an unsupervised method of clustering datasets in such amanner that a data point may belong to more than one cluster with varying degree of membership. The algorithm, based on fuzzy sets, is an extension of K-Means clustering. 

A simple implementation of FCM has been coded in MATLAB here.
